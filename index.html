        <h3>Tell me if this sounds familiar…
        </h3>
        <p> It's like a fire burning inside you. 
        </p>
        <p>The morning greets you with a relentless grip that tightens your chest…
        </p>
        <p>Making it hard to breathe.
        </p>
        <p>At breakfast, swallowing becomes a challenge. 
        </p>
        <p>Every bite feels like shards of glass scratching your throat. 
        </p>
        <p>The taste of acid rises, bitter and uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>Work stress triggers another flare-up. 
        </p>
        <p>The discomfort lingers, distracting you from your tasks. 
        </p>
        <p>It's frustrating, to say the least.
        </p>
        <p>Lunchtime arrives, and you hesitate. 
        </p>
        <p>Will this meal bring relief or add fuel to the fire? 
        </p>
        <p>Even simple foods have become your enemies. 
        </p>
        <p>Spicy dishes, once a favorite, are now forbidden, intensifying your frustration.
        </p>
        <p>And to make things worse…
        </p>
        <p>Doctor visits only offer temporary relief. 
        </p>
        <p>He tells you you have H. pylori eating up your stomach walls…
        </p>
        <p>So he prescribes antacids, like Tums or Rolaids, to bring fleeting moments of respite.</p>
        <p>And he tells you to stop taking aspirin and other NSAIDs.</p>
        <p>But still, none of this is giving you the kind of comfort that makes life enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>You've tried proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Prilosec or Nexium, hoping for a breakthrough, but disappointment persists.</p>
        <p>To sleep becomes a battle. 
        </p>
        <p>Because merely lying down intensifies the burning agony…
        </p>
        <p>Leaving you restless…
        </p>
        <p>Tossing and turning…
        </p>
        <p>Longing for relief that never seems to come.
        </p>
        <p>Ulcer…
        </p>
        <p>Heartburn…
        </p>
        <p>Acid reflux… 
        </p>
        <p>These are all problems that take the joy out of a person’s life,

        </p>
        <p>Making one feel trapped in a cycle of frustration…
        </p>
        <p>Seeking relief but finding only disappointment.

        <p>All of that and more is coming up on this page.</p>
        <p>But before we get started, I should introduce myself.
        </p>
        <p>Hi, I'm Emmanuel Ogunde.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a microbiologist and a specialist in bacteriology.</p>
        <p>For over 20 years, I've been in the forefront of exploring the intriguing relationship between humans and the microorganisms in our bodies and our environment.
        </p>
        <p>I've traveled around quite a lot, attending several conferences, and learning from some of the brightest minds in my field.
        </p>
        <p>This journey has given me deep insights into how these microscopic organisms influence our health.
        </p>
        <p>But it was a personal experience that led me down a new path in my research -- my wife.
        </p>
        <p>My wife has always been the stronger half of us. 
        </p>
        <p>But then she got down with a severe case of stomach ulcer.

        </p>
        <p>We tried everything. 
        </p>
        <p>Every recommended drug, every promising treatment, every esteemed specialist. Nothing helped.
        </p>
        <p>I watched my wife wince in pain, her hands clutching her stomach. 
        </p>
        <p>She would force a smile, pretending she was fine. 
        </p>
        <p>But I could see the agony in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Our home felt like a revolving door of doctors…
        </p>
        <p>Each one leaving with a shrug and an "I'm sorry, we're trying our best."
        </p>
        <p>I felt helpless. 
        </p>
        <p>As a husband and a scientist, I couldn't accept that.
        </p>
        <p>So, I turned my work towards finding a solution.
        </p>
        <p>Thus began my journey of exploration and discovery. 
        </p>
        <p>A journey into the world of bacteria…
        </p>
        <p>But this time with a focus on those that wreak havoc on our stomachs, causing ulcers, heartburn, and acid reflux.
        </p>
        <p>My passion was fuelled by a singular image - my wife's pain-filled eyes.
        </p>
        <p>I began studying.
        </p>
        <p>I thought it would only take a few hours.
        </p>
        <p>But hours turned into days…
        </p>
        <p>Days into weeks…
        </p>
        <p>And weeks into months.
        </p>
        <p>First, I didn't see anything new.
        </p>
        <p>It was generic advice like:
        </p>
        <p>Cut out alcohol…
        </p>
        <p>Stop taking NSAIDs…
        </p>
        <p>Limit spicy foods…
        </p>
        <p>And antibiotics that I was seeing.
        </p>
        <p>But just before I gave up…
        </p>
        <p>I started seeing a new strand of evidence. 
        </p>
        <p>Something that sounded completely different from the popular advice.
        </p>
        <p>And that was backed by multiple independent scientific research.
        </p>
        <p>I saw hope. 
        </p>
        <p>Hope for a solution that could remove the pains of wife…
        </p>
        <p>And the millions of people suffering from ulcer, heartburn, and acid reflux that just won't go.
        </p>
        <p>And then, it happened.
        </p>
        <p>Through rigorous research, I stumbled upon a method, a 7-second reset approach that specifically targets the root cause of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>And when I finally cracked the code…
        </p>
        <p> The improvement was miraculous. 
        </p>
        <p>My wife started eating without pain again…
        </p>
        <p>She says it doesn't feel like each food lights up a fire inside her anymore…
        </p>
        <p>Her nights became restful…
        </p>
        <p>And it showed on her face.
        </p>
        <p>Her radiant smile returned too…
        </p>
        <p>And this time, I could tell it was genuine (not forced).
        </p>
        <p>My heart, once heavy with worry, was filled with joy and relief.
        </p>
        <p>This breakthrough spurred me to share my knowledge…
        </p>
        <p>To offer hope and relief to others facing similar health issues. 
        </p>
        <p>To assure you that there is a way out of the pain and discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>Pay close attention here.
        </p>
        <p>Time for the truth. 
        </p><br>

        <h1 class="text-center">The Real Culprit Behind Ulcer, Heartburn, And Acid Refluxes That Just Won’t Go 
           <span style="color: red;;"><U>Your Doctor NEVER Thought Of This</U></span> 
            </h1><br>

        <p>As I dug into a mountain of research…
        </p>
        <p>Everything pointed me back to something very simple and essential to our normal functioning…
        </p>
        <p>But the same one that many doctors never pay attention to.
        </p>
        <p><strong><u>The Gut!</u></strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>Let's see what's really going on.
        </p>
        <p>Think of your body as a well-guarded palace.</p>
        <p>Think of somewhere really secure like Aso Rock.
        </p>
        <p>It's full of diligent soldiers - bacteria, viruses, fungi - that form an army known as your gut microbiome. 
        </p>
        <p>They're loyal to your cause…
        </p>
        <p>Protecting the stronghold of your gut. 
        </p>
        <p>Usually, these microbes maintain order. 
        </p><br>

        <ul><li>They facilitate digestion. 
        </li></ul><br>
        <ul><li>They strengthen your immune defenses. 

        </li></ul><br>
        <ul><li>They maintain the health of your gut walls.
        </li></ul><br>

        <p>It's an ideal balance. 
        </p>
        <p>A strategic military operation.
        </p>
        <p>But what happens when the army loses its formation? 
        </p>
        <p>When the strategy falls apart? 
        </p>
        <p>That's when the damage starts. 
        </p>
        <p>That's when ulcers, heartburn, and acid reflux start their troubles. 
        </p>
        <p>What triggers this imbalance?
        </p>
        <p>Could it be frequent use of antibiotics? Possibly a poor diet.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe it's chronic stress or previous infections.
        </p>
        <p>Any of these can disrupt the healthy balance in your gut.
        </p>
        <p>Your gut's defensive walls become compromised.
        </p>
        <p>Left exposed.
        </p>
        <p>That's when ulcers, heartburn, and acid reflux find their foothold.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Let Me Make This Clearer.
        </strong></p>
        <p>Your gut's soldiers usually form a strong shield.
        </p>
        <p>They resist enemy forces like stomach acid and digestive enzymes.
        </p>
        <p>But when the balance is upset, this shield weakens.
        </p>
        <p>Your stomach lining becomes vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>Bacteria and acids start eating into your cell wall…
        </p>
        <p>Causing big wounds that your body can’t heal from without external help.
        </p>
        <p>Ulcers emerge, heartburn flares, or acid reflux steps in.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center"><strong>But wait, it gets worse!
        </strong></h1>

        <p>The imbalanced gut army triggers chronic inflammation in your gut.
        </p>
        <p>It's like launching a full-blown attack on your own body.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, it weakens your immune system.
        </p>
        <p>It becomes harder for your body to repel infections, especially the notorious H. pylori bacteria…
        </p>
        <p>Which I'm sure you've heard causes several digestive problems.
        </p>
        <p>Your body struggles to repair.
        </p>
        <p>The stubborn ulcers persist. The heartburn doesn't relent. Acid reflux continues to cause discomfort.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What about those antibiotics, omeprazole, herbs, and other renowned remedies for these ailments?
        </strong></p>
        <p>They aim to reduce the acid in your stomach. 
        </p>
        <p>They offer temporary relief. 
        </p>
        <p>But they miss the real issue - <b><u>the disrupted balance in your gut microbiome</u></b>.
        </p><br>

            <h1 class="text-center"> <strong> Worse Yet, H. Pylori Bacteria Can Grow Resistant To Antibiotics. </strong></h1><br>

        <p>They become tough to eliminate. 
        </p>
        <p>And here's the kicker: prolonged use of acid-reducing medications can further disrupt your gut's balance. 
        </p>
        <p>This makes it even harder for your gut to heal and recover.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine a vibrant city thrown into chaos. 
        </p>
        <p>It turns into a wasteland. 
        </p>
        <p>You wouldn’t just paint over the spot where you hit your car with another car,  would you? 
        </p>
        <p>It's the same with your gut. 
        </p>
        <p>It needs a total reboot. 
        </p>
        <p>Restoration of harmony.
        </p>
        <p>So, how do we restore the harmony? 
        </p>
        <p>Let's dive into that.
        </p>
        <p>Well, the first thing you might think is that you can just soothe your ulcer, heartburn, or acid reflux by following a specific diet.
        </p>
        <p>And while I’m certainly not going to tell you that dietary changes are BAD for you…
        </p>
        <p>When it comes to these problems, it's not as straightforward as that.
        </p>
        <p>You can modify your diet all you want…
        </p>
        <p>But unless it actually addresses the root cause of your problem…
        </p>
        <p>The imbalance in your gut…
        </p>
        <p>It won't do much other than give you temporary relief.
        </p>
        <p>So, unfortunately, relying solely on diet modifications isn't enough to stop the pain for good.
        </p>
        <p>Reading this…
        </p>
        <p>I realized why making my wife cut out spicy foods only helped a bit but not too well.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center"><strong>The next thing you might turn to is popular over-the-counter remedies like Antacids, PPIs, and Similar Stuff</strong>.
        </h1><br>

        <p>These promise quick relief and claim to soothe the pain in no time.
        </p>
        <p>And they can provide temporary relief, I won't deny that.
        </p>
        <p>But obviously, there are some problems with these remedies.
        </p>
        <p>For one, the relief they offer is often short-lived and doesn't address the underlying issue causing your ulcer, heartburn, or acid reflux.
        </p>
        <p>This means you have to keep buying these remedies repeatedly…
        </p>
        <p>Spending your hard-earned money without getting lasting results.
        </p>
        <p>And let's be honest…
        </p>
        <p>Who wants to constantly rely on these remedies, wasting their time and money without actually solving the problem?
        </p>
        <p>But beyond the frustration of constantly needing these remedies and the financial burden they can cause...
        </p>
        <p>The BIGGEST issue with them is that they simply mask the symptoms of the problem without truly attacking it from within.
        </p>
        <p>The ONLY way you can achieve lasting relief and healing is by addressing the root cause of your ulcer.
        </p>
        <p>Once you do, it's like bringing out these wounds and truly healing your ulcer from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p>By focusing on a holistic approach that targets the root cause, you can experience the relief and freedom you've been longing for.
        </p>
        <p><strong>But just how do you do that?
        </strong></p>
        <p>Well, at first I couldn’t find anything.
        </p>
        <p>But then I found a research that changed everything for me.
        </p>
        <p>But eventually, I stumbled across some fascinating research studies about a natural herb that does wonders for ulcers, acid reflux, and heart burns.
        </p>
        <p>And its remarkable potential for helping to eliminate ulcers and re-establish balance in the gut microbiome.
        </p>
        <p>The scientific investigations around this herb are simply thrilling.
        </p>
        <p>In a particular study led by the Gastroenterohepatology Research Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.
        </p>
        <p>They compared a common therapy for peptic ulcers with an altered therapy that included this potent herb.
        </p>
        <p>They distributed 40 patients with peptic ulcers into two groups.
        </p>
        <p>One group was given a popular med for ulcers and heartburn…
        </p>
        <p>Just like omeprazole.
        </p>
        <p>The other group received this mysterious herb instead.
        </p>
        <p>The treatment spanned 30 days, and the outcomes were astonishing.
        </p>
        <p>After just one month, the researchers noticed that an incredible 70% of the patients taking this herb experienced healing.
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/70%.png" alt=""><br>

        <p>Moreover, when it came to eliminating H. pylori, the bacterium often linked with ulcers…
        </p>
        <p>This herb demonstrated a 70% eradication effect, compared to a mere 45% in the other group.
        </p>

        <img src="img/mystery-herb.png" alt=""><br>

        <p>Breath test results were equally promising, with this herb showing a 55% eradication rate, while the other one lagged behind at 40%.
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/breath-test.png" alt=""><br>

        <p>Now, that's some potent stuff!
        </p>
        <p>Another study involving 120 adults with dyspepsia, a condition causing stomach pain, showed that consuming this herb extract in conjunction with standard treatment significantly decreased the presence of H. pylori.
        </p>
        <p>Can you see that?
        </p>
        <p>This magical herb stepping up and taking down those ulcers!
        </p>
        <p>And it doesn't stop there.
        </p>
        <p>There's a study where the extract of this herb was used to treat 100 patients with stomach ulcers for six weeks. 
        </p>
        <p>And guess what? 
        </p>
        <p>A whopping 90% of the patients improved, with ulcers completely disappearing in 22 of them. 
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/90%.png" alt=""><br>


        <p>Talk about a game-changer!</p>
        <p>This herb is called:</p><br>
        <h1><strong>Licorice</strong>
        </h1>

        <img src="img/licorice 2.png" alt=""><br>

        <p>Licorice has been proven in several independent research to help resolve cases of gut microbe imbalance…
</p>
        <p>Which has been linked to reducing the presence and severity of ulcers, heartburn, acid reflux and several other digestive problems.
        </p>
        <p>You see, for countless generations…
        </p>
        <p>People in India have used Yastimadhu for a long time. 
        </p>
        <p>They knew it was good for the tummy before scientists even figured it out! 
        </p>
        <p>This herb can help with problems like tummy aches, ulcers, heartburn, and acid reflux. 
        </p>
        <p>Yastimadhu has been a revered ingredient in Indian households…
        </p>
        <p>Handed down from grandmothers to their granddaughters…
        </p>
        <p>For its almost magical abilities to soothe digestive issues. 
        </p>
        <p>Long before science could catch up…
        </p>
        <p> Indian healers knew the power locked within this humble root.
        </p>
        <p>All from a root dug up from the earth!
        </p>
        <p>Fast forward to the 21st century…
        </p>
        <p>Scientific research now confirms what the ancients always knew. The healing power of Licorice is undeniable.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve shown you a few studies showing the amazing benefit of Licorice.
        </p>
        <p>But hold on tight, because there's more.
        </p>
        <p>In yet another study, 33 patients with gastric ulcers were treated with a form of Licorice or a dummy for a month. 
        </p>
        <p>And get this, the group that took this special form of Licorice showed a significantly greater reduction in ulcer size, a whopping 78%, compared to just 34% in the dummy group. 
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/reduction.png" alt=""><br>

        <p class="text-center">Complete healing occurred in 44% of those receiving Licorice, but only 6% in the dummy group. 
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/complete.png" alt=""><br>

        <p>Researchers conducted two noteworthy clinical studies examining Licorice's effects on upper GI issues. 
        </p>
        <p>The participants, who were dealing with symptoms like acid reflux, heartburn, and an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest and throat, reported significant relief.
        </p>
        <p>These studies provided solid evidence that this potent herb…
        </p>
        <p>Consumed regularly…
        </p>
        <p>Can help manage and even alleviate these troublesome symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>A study conducted by Brown et al. found that a combination of apple cider vinegar (ACV), licorice, and papain significantly improved upper gastrointestinal symptoms including indigestion, heartburn, regurgitation (acid reflux), and nausea after 12 weeks.

        <p>That's some serious healing power right there.</p>
        <p>Now, let's tie all of this together.
        </p>
        <p>These studies demonstrate how licorice can work wonders when it comes to eradicating ulcers, heartburns, and acid refluxes and restoring balance to the gut microbiome. 
        </p>
        <p>Licorice promotes healing…

        <p>Eradicates H. pylori…

        <p>In a safe and completely natural way.
        </p>

        <h5 class="text-center"><strong>Now I know the thought in your head is to look up Licorice online.
        </h5></strong> <br>

        <h3 class="text-center" style="color: #e93f33;">Hold up! 
        </h3>

        <p>Before you go clicking off and heading to online stores to buy any old licorice product…
        </p>
        <p>There's something important you need to know. 
        </p>
        <p>And trust me, it's a game-changer.
        </p>
        <p>Here's the scoop: 
        </p>
        <p>Most licorice products out there are simply not worth your hard-earned cash. 
        </p>
        <p>Seriously. 
        </p>
        <p>95% of manufacturers are more interested in their bottom line than in delivering a high-quality product. 
        </p>
        <p>They skimp on the quality ingredients…
        </p>
        <p>Leaving you with underdosed formulations, while still charging you a pretty penny. 
        </p>
        <p>And to make matters worse…
        </p>
        <p>They load up their licorice with preservatives that strip away their amazing ulcer-removing powers. 
        </p>
        <p>Talk about a letdown.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I get it. 
        </p>
        <p>You're probably thinking…
        </p>
        <p><strong>"Well, I'll just hop online and find a reputable source."</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>Let me tell you, it's not that easy. 
        </p>
        <p>Believe me, I've been down that road. 
        </p>
        <p>I scoured the internet tirelessly, desperately searching for a solution.
        </p>
        <p> I was on the verge of throwing in the towel when out of the blue…
        </p>
        <p>I stumbled upon a mind-blowing brand of licorice that had people raving online.
        </p>
        <p>Now, here's the kicker. 
        </p>
        <p>This incredible company hails from India…
        </p>
        <p>And they've got something truly special brewing. 
        </p>
        <p>Brace yourself for this.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike those other supplement companies that cram their formulas with a mishmash of underdosed ingredients…
        </p>
        <p><u><i><strong>Some of which might even clash inside your body...</strong></i></u>
        </p>
        <p>Just to make their products look fancy…
        </p> 
        <p>This company takes a refreshingly different approach. 
        </p>
        <p>They keep it simple and focused. 
        </p>
        <p>Their formula contains only one superstar ingredient:
        </p>

        <h3>Licorice!</h3>

        <p>Yup, that's it. 
        </p>
        <p>No unnecessary fillers or additives. 
        </p>
        <p>Just pure, potent licorice goodness.
        </p>
        <p>But wait, there's more!
        </p>
        <p> Unlike those mass-production supplement factories that churn out bottle after bottle…
        </p>
        <p>As much as 100,000 bottles per week…</p>
        <p>Sacrificing quality along the way to line their pockets…
        </p>
        <p>This company is all about integrity. 
        </p>
        <p>They produce a modest 8,000 bottles per month. 
        </p>

        <img src="img/volume.png" alt="volume"><br>


        <p>Why? Because they refuse to cut corners or compromise on quality. 
        </p>
        <p>They know that true excellence requires attention to detail and ensuring that each and every bottle meets their rigorous standards.
        </p>
        <p><u><strong>Now, here's the catch. 
        </strong></u></p>
        <p>Because they value quality over quantity…
        </p>
        <p>It means there is usually a lot of waiting involved to get your hands on their miraculous formula. 
        </p>
        <p>I know, it's a bit of a downer. 
        </p>
        <p>But trust me when I say, the wait is absolutely worth it. 
        </p>
        <p>Their dedication to producing a top-notch product is unmatched.
        </p>
        <p>And I'm delighted to present to you,
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>Unlike most supplements you’ll find that you can’t be sure what their quality is…
        </p>
        <p>Yastimadhu has NAFDAC original seal of approval.
        </p>
        <p>Which certifies that Yastimadhu works and it’s a completely safe remedy for people living with mild to serious ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux.
        </p>
        <p>NAFDAC’s approval is still child’s play when you compare with US FDA’s approval
        </p>
        <p>Now, you might be wondering…
        </p>


        <h3>"What's the US FDA and why is their approval a big deal?"
        </h3>

        <p> Well, let me explain!
        </p>
        <p>FDA stands for the Food and Drug Administration. 
        </p>
        <p>It's like a big boss in America that checks if food and medicine are safe and good for people to use. 
        </p>
        <p>And when I say big boss, I mean REALLY BIG boss! 
        </p>
        <p>If the FDA says something's good, then you can trust it's really, really good.
        </p>
        <p>So, when the FDA visited the ultra-modern lab where Yastimadhu is made…
        </p>
        <p>Ready to shut down the whole production at the slightest mistake in quality….
        </p>
        <p>They looked at everything…</p>
        <p>They tore the whole place down…
        </p>
        <p>From the Licorice plants to the way the herb is prepared …
        </p>
        <p>To where the final Yastimadhu is bottled and sent for third part testing…
        </p>
        <p>They were completely BLOWN AWAY
        </p>
        <p>The United States FDA approval is like the highest stamp of approval any food or drug can get.
        </p>
        <p>It means the Licorice we're getting for you is super safe, super clean, and super good.
        </p>
        <p>The FDA doesn't just give out approvals like candy. 
        </p>
        <p>You can’t buy their approval with money.
        </p>
        <p>They make sure everything is up to their high standards. 
        </p>
        <p>They’re in charge of lives of over 300 million Americans…
        </p>
        <p>And they’re very brutal at their job.
        </p>
        <p>So, an FDA approval is like a gold star saying, "This is top quality!"
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>In fact, you don't even need to invest #60,000 or even #50,000.
        </p>
        <p>We are thrilled to offer a month’s supply of Yastimadhu at a special price of just #45,500.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, you read that right. 
        </p>
        <p>For just over a thousand naira per day…
        </p>
        <p>You can get your hands on a breakthrough solution that has already helped over 25,600 people like you find freedom from the relentless search for a cure.
        </p>
        <p>But that's not all…

        <p>Because you’ve made it this far into the presentation, it's obvious you're serious about your health. 
        </p>
        <p>And you’re interested in seeing how this one-of-a-kind solution can help you… 
        </p>
        <p>The same way it's helping thousands of others. 
        </p>
        <p>This is why I went to give you the opportunity to try this new formulation at a special price… available only through this page.
        </p>
        <p>Today, and for a limited time, I'd like to offer you a bottle of Yastimadhu, (a 30-day supply) for just #37,500 only.
        </p>
        <p>That’s almost 45% off the retail price.
        </p>
        <p>But take note: this is the only place you'll find Yastimadhu…
        </p>
        <p>And at such an affordable price.
        </p>
        <p>You won't find this Yastimadhu on Jumia or anywhere else.
        </p>
        <p>And here's the best part…
        </p>
        <p>While many users report significant relief in as little as a week… </p>
        <p>The true magic unfolds when you take Yastimadhu for 3 months or more. </p>
        <p>That's because Yastimadhu’s ingredients accumulate in your system, consistently soothing and healing your ulcers for optimal health.
        </p>
        <p>Think about it this way: 
        </p>
        <p>Yastimadhu is like a dedicated team, working round-the-clock to restore your health. 
        </p>
        <p>It needs time to ensure that there is enough licorice to saturate your body…
        </p>
        <p>And reset your microbiome imbalance so your body can heal itself.
        </p>
        <p>It trains your body to fight off the deadly H. Pylori bacteria…
        </p>
        <p> while repairing the walls of your stomach to end the pain.
        </p>
        <p>This means the longer you take Yastimadhu… the better you feel.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine it like compound interest.
        </p>
        <p>Every morning you take Yastimadhu, you invest in your health. 
        </p>
        <p>And the benefits keep compounding.
        </p>
        <p>First, gradually, then, more rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>Just as you wouldn't want to withdraw your savings before they've grown…
        </p>
        <p>It's crucial not to interrupt the healing process that Yastimadhu initiates. 
        </p>
        <p>Many people usually order the larger bottles.
        </p>
        <p>Because they don't want to risk leaving their progress halfway or risk strengthening H. Pylori…
        </p>
        <p>and making their pain more unbearable.
        </p>
        <p>Also because the makers of Yastimadhu can only produce 8,000 bottles a month - nowhere near enough for the hundreds of thousands seeking relief.
        </p>
        <p>To this effect, we created special and more discounted prices for the 3 month and 6 month packs…
        </p>
        <p>Which gives you access to Yastimadhu enough to last you 3 and 6 months respectively. 
        </p>
        <p>Our popular package is the 3-bottle option…
        </p>
        <p>Which gives you access to Yastimadhu for just #25,600 per bottle.
        </p>
        <p>It also ensures you don't have to worry about running out. 
        </p>
        <p>The people who want to save the most amount of money…
        </p>
        <p>And want to be covered for the maximum time choose the 6-month plan.
        </p>
        <p>With the 6-month supply, you’ll be saving #90,000 instantly.
        </p>
        <p>Because then a bottle of Yastimadhu comes down to only 22,500.
        </p>
        <p>Plus, you can avoid future price increases due to CBN and rising dollar rates.
        </p>
        <p>With Yastimadhu, you can enjoy your favorite meals without fear. 
        </p>
        <p>Say goodbye to the pain and discomfort that once held you hostage.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine eating without worry…
        </p>
        <p>Being able to fully enjoy social gatherings without fearing the next meal. 
        </p>
        <p>Listen, I don't mean to press you.

        </p>

        <p>Each leading to drastically different outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>The first road is the same old road...
        </p>
        <p>This road is where you keep using the same old treatments for your ulcers, heartburn, and acid reflux, even though they haven't been helping.
        </p>
        <p>If you keep walking on this road, you know what will happen.
        </p>
        <p>Your tummy troubles, like ulcers, heartburn, and acid reflux, will get worse, spreading to all parts of your life.
        </p>
        <p>This means constant pain...
        </p>
        <p>Making even easy jobs feel very hard.
        </p>
        <p>Think about the sleepless nights spent moving and turning...
        </p>
        <p>Your mind filled with discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine sitting at the dinner table...
        </p>
        <p>Looking at food you can't enjoy...
        </p>
        <p>Because these tummy troubles took away the simple joy of eating.
        </p>
        <p>Eating becomes hard, and swallowing feels painful because of your pains.
        </p>
        <p>Your friends and family feel sad as they see you in pain.
        </p>
        <p>You start to skip parties and fun times...
        </p>
        <p>Because your pain is always there.
        </p>
        <p>Your happy laughter becomes quiet...
        </p>
        <p>Covered up by constant pain.
        </p>
        <p>This is not the way life should be lived.
        </p>
        <p>But don't lose hope, because there's another road.
        </p>
        <p>The second road is the road to feeling better.
        </p>
        <p>This is the road of Yastimadhu...

        </p>
        <p>Think about the freedom you will feel...
        </p>
        <p>The ability to do all parts of your life again...
        </p>
